# Constraint-driven latent/observation classification (issue #95,
# docs/constraint-driven-conditioning.md). A choice is an observation iff its
# address is in the constraints at inference time; binding is orthogonal. These
# regression tests pin the PR-2 scope: the compiled `logjoint` path derives the
# latent/observation split from the conditioning signature, so it agrees with
# `generate`/`assess`, honors a constraint on a BOUND address (the #95 bug),
# treats an unbound unconstrained choice as a slotted latent, and memoizes the
# resolved plan per signature.

# The #95 reproduction model: `:y` is bound (`y = ({:y} ~ ...)`) yet may be
# observed. Under the old syntactic rule the compiled scoring silently ignored a
# constraint on `:y`; under the conditioning rule it is honored.
