# Mask-based iterative doubling for batched NUTS (NumPyro-style lockstep).
#
# Unlike the hybrid path (depth-cohort scheduler plus the per-chain scalar
# recursion tail in tree_dynamics.jl), every chain runs the same doubling round
# at the same time: round r expands a subtree of 2^r leaves through repeated
# masked single-leaf steps, then all started chains merge. A chain that
# diverges or turns mid-subtree drops out of the expand mask but stays in the
# round for the merge; a chain whose continuation terminates (turning,
# divergence, or max depth) leaves the active set between rounds. Every
# leapfrog step is one full-width batched gradient call -- masked lanes waste
# gradient work by design; that is exactly the shape device gradients need.
# All active chains share the same tree depth (== round index), so no chain
# ever falls out of lockstep and the scalar tail is never entered.
#
# The per-leaf and per-merge math is the existing cohort machinery
# (_advance_batched_nuts_subtree_cohort!, _merge_batched_nuts_subtree_cohort!,
# and the tree_expand.jl helpers they call); this file only replaces the
# depth-cohort scheduler with a single all-active-chains round loop. The
# kernel access structs are built once per phase with the block masks aliasing
# the live workspace arrays, so the expand mask shrinks in place.
#
# RNG order (deterministic under a seed):
#   1. initialization: shared with the hybrid path (momentum for all chains,
#      one direction per chain, one first-step proposal draw per valid chain,
#      chain-major).
#   2. per round: one direction draw per chain (all chains, chain-major),
#      whether or not the chain is still active.
#   3. per leaf step: one proposal-selection draw per chain still in the
#      expand mask, in chain order (skipped while the running subtree log
#      weight is -Inf, exactly as in _advance_tree_leaf).
#   4. per merge: one draw per merging chain in chain order, consumed only
#      when that chain's subtree log weight is finite (_merge_subtree_stats).
