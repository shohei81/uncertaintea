"""
    gibbs(model, args=(), constraints=choicemap(); num_samples, kwargs...)

MH-within-Gibbs for models with discrete latent sites (docs/mh-within-gibbs.md):
each iteration sweeps the discrete sites with symmetric single-site
Metropolis-Hastings updates, then advances the continuous block with one NUTS
transition conditioned on the current discrete values. Discrete sites are
discovered automatically (every non-observed choice without a parameter slot
that is not `marginalize=:enumerate`); a model without discrete sites reduces
to plain NUTS, and a model without continuous slots to pure single-site MH.

Returns a [`GibbsChain`](@ref) with the continuous samples and per-site
discrete samples. The NUTS keyword arguments mirror [`nuts`](@ref); the
prior initial state is retried when observations rule it out, and
`initial_discrete` (a choicemap over site addresses) seeds specific
discrete values when the prior cannot reach the posterior's support.
