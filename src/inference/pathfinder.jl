# Pathfinder variational initialization (Zhang, Carpenter, Gelman, Vehtari
# 2022): run L-BFGS toward the mode of the unconstrained log joint, build a
# Gaussian approximation N(mu_l, Sigma_l) at every iterate from the L-BFGS
# inverse-Hessian estimate (mu_l = x_l + Sigma_l g_l, one quasi-Newton step),
# score each by a Monte Carlo ELBO, and keep the best. Multi-path mode pools
# draws from several independent paths by importance resampling. Sigma_l is
# materialized densely from the two-loop recursion -- O(d^2 m) per iterate,
# fine for the CPU reference scale; the paper's O(d m) factorized form is a
# possible future optimization.

Pathfinder variational initialization (Zhang et al. 2022): L-BFGS runs toward
the posterior mode in unconstrained space, every accepted iterate yields a
Gaussian approximation built from the L-BFGS inverse-Hessian estimate, and a
Monte Carlo ELBO selects the best one. With `num_paths > 1`, the paths start
from independent prior initializations and the returned `draws` pool the
per-path draws by importance resampling against the equal mixture of the
path Gaussians (Pareto smoothing of the weights is a possible refinement).
Every returned draw has a finite log joint.

The result can be passed directly as `initial_params` to `hmc`/`nuts`/
`nuts_chains`/`batched_hmc`/`batched_nuts`, which then start each chain from
a Pathfinder draw instead of a prior draw.
