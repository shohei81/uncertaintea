# Pointwise log-likelihood extraction.
#
# This mirrors the compiled scoring walk in `evaluator.jl` (`_score_compiled_steps` /
# `_score_plan_step!`) but instead of summing every choice's logpdf it *records* the
# per-observation logpdf for every observation.
#
# The observation/latent split is taken from the CONDITIONING SIGNATURE (issue #95),
# exactly as `logjoint` and the batched/device paths do: the walk runs over the
# signature-resolved compiled plan, in which a static choice constrained at inference
# time carries no parameter slot (so it reads its value from the constraints and is
# recorded), while any unconstrained static choice is a slotted latent. This keeps the
# recorded observations identical to `observation_addresses` and to the scoring paths.
#
# marginalize=:enumerate latents (issue #88, docs/discrete-enumeration.md): an
# enumerated discrete latent is NEVER an observation (it has no slot and is not
# constrained), so it is not recorded as a data column. Instead the walk computes the
# correct MARGINAL pointwise log-likelihood for the observations in its enumeration
# suffix, integrating the latent out with the same logsumexp the marginalized logjoint
# uses. See `_record_marginalized_choice!` for the supported/rejected structures.

# marginalize=:enumerate pointwise likelihood (issue #88).
#
# For an unconstrained enumerated latent `z`, the correct per-observation marginal
# likelihood integrates `z` out. Writing the observations in `z`'s suffix as `y_k`, the
# marginal joint of the suffix data is
#
#     p(data | theta) = sum_z p(z) * prod_k p(y_k | z, theta).
#
# Splitting the observations into those whose density does NOT depend on `z` (set `I`)
# and those that do (set `D`),
#
#     p(data | theta) = [prod_{k in I} p(y_k)] * sum_z p(z) prod_{k in D} p(y_k | z).
#
# The z-independent factors decompose per observation directly. The dependent block is a
# SINGLE joint term over all of `D`; it decomposes into per-observation pointwise terms
# only when |D| <= 1:
#
#   * |D| == 0: the enumerated latent affects no recorded observation; every observation
#     is z-independent and recorded as its own logpdf (`sum_z p(z) == 1`).
#   * |D| == 1: the one dependent observation `y*` gets the marginal
#     `log sum_z p(z) p(y*|z) = logsumexp_z(logpdf(z) + logpdf(y*|z))`; the rest are
#     recorded directly. This is the common case (the #88 repro: one enumerated
#     indicator local to one observation).
#   * |D| >= 2: `log sum_z p(z) prod_k p(y_k|z)` does not factorize into per-observation
#     terms (the observations are dependent given theta once z is summed out); a clear
#     error is raised.
#
# Nested marginalize=:enumerate latents in the suffix are handled by recursion, so the
# supported set includes the factorizing nested cases: independent enumerated latents
# feeding separate observations decompose per column, and several enumerated latents all
# feeding a SINGLE observation give that column its full multi-sum marginal. A nested
# structure whose observations are genuinely entangled is still caught by the |D| >= 2
# check at whichever enumeration level shares two observations.
#
# Structures rejected up front (non-factorizing for pointwise purposes):
#   * a free (slotted) latent inside the enumeration suffix -- its prior can depend on
#     `z`, which would reweight the enumeration in a way the per-observation
#     decomposition cannot see; place the enumerated site after all continuous latents;
#   * an enumerated latent whose value changes the SET of downstream observations.
#
# A CONSTRAINED enumerated latent is an observation like any other fixed value: it is
# recorded and its suffix is walked once at that value (this factorizes trivially).
