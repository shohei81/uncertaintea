# Public registration API for user-defined distributions.
#
# A distribution defined outside the package participates in `@tea` models via
# the CPU reference path (generate/assess/logjoint and the ForwardDiff
# gradient fallback) once registered here. Registered families are honestly
# reported unsupported by `backend_report`/`device_report`, exactly like the
# built-in CPU-only families.
#
# Contract for the registered builder's return value:
#   - subtype `UncertainTea.AbstractTeaDistribution`
#   - extend `UncertainTea.logpdf(dist, x)` (return -Inf outside the support;
#     keep it ForwardDiff-Dual-friendly if the family is used as a latent)
#   - extend `Random.rand(rng::AbstractRNG, dist)`
#
# Registration is consulted when a `@tea` model is DEFINED, so register a
# family before defining models that use it (the same order Julia requires
# for any function you call at top level).

    register_distribution(family::Symbol; builder, transform=nothing)

Register a user-defined distribution so `x ~ \$family(args...)` works inside
`@tea` models. `builder` is the function (or type constructor) called with the
model-side arguments; it must return an `AbstractTeaDistribution` implementing
`UncertainTea.logpdf(dist, x)` and `Random.rand(rng, dist)`.

`transform` declares the unconstrained parameterization used when the family
appears as a latent: one of the exported parameter transforms (e.g.
`IdentityTransform()` for real-line support, `LogTransform()` for positive
support, `LogitTransform()` for (0,1), `BoundedTransform(lower, upper)`).
Leave it `nothing` for observation-only families -- a latent then gets no
parameter slot, matching how unsupported built-in latents behave.

Registering an already-registered family overwrites it; models keep the
builder that was registered when they were defined/compiled, so re-register
before redefining models. Built-in family names cannot be overridden.
